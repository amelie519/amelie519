### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Amelie- amabdula@my.waketech.edu
This github account, though originally created a few years ago for personal projects, is now being used for school learning through my classes. I still plan on using it for personal projects when I can, however.
This repository is specifically for an assignment meant to introduce me and my classmates to github and its features. This one will be used to store future class projects.
To clone this repository, I downloaded the github desktop application, signed into my account, found this (amelie519) repository, and simply clicked "clone repository"
